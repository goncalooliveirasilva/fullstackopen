# Full Stack Open Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to the [Full Stack Open](https://fullstackopen.com/en/) course by the [University of Helsinki](https://www.helsinki.fi/en).  
The course focuses on building **single-page web applications (SPAs)** with React that communicate with RESTful and GraphQL backends.  
Along the way, it covers modern web development tools and practices such as **Redux, Node.js, MongoDB, TypeScript, testing, and containerization**.

Currently working on: **Part 11 – CI/CD**
